# What's this all about?

Hi there!
I'm Matthias, 20 years old, living in Germany and studying computer science. There isn't much more to say about me. I love what I am doing and am constantly working on several small and large projects which I will document here. As I am switching to another university, I have a semester _free time_ which I will use to pick some entries on my todo list and work on them.
Some projects/posts will be about general computer stuff, some about my experience with watercooling, some hardware projects, 3D printing and astro photography.
By the way - xvzf is my user name. tar xvzf was the first linux command which I used the most (ironic, right?), so that became my token.

# Tech stuff
This blog is based on [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) - basically a static site generator. I first wanted to use a well known CMS for this project - but I litteraly hate PHP and web developing in general which lead me to use Jekyll!
The theme is based on [BlackDoc](https://github.com/karloespiritu/BlackDoc) by Karlo Espiritu. Thanks for the awesome theme! I just changed the font and the colors to suit the [Numix project](https://numixproject.org/).
The server is running [ArchLinux](https://www.archlinux.org/) with the latest LTS kernel. ArchLinux is my goto linux distribution - I use it for everything! 

# The first few things to happen
I have several projects as a starting point - However I will hold back a little until my exams are finished!
The first "large" project is in a alpha state and called [CAM4LINUX](https://github.com/xvzf/cam4linux). But more on that later! A detailed article on [golem.de](https://www.golem.de/) will follow on this topic also, which might get things started here!
