# So what is this all about? 

Hey!
I'm Milian im 21 years old, live in Germany and work in IT, as Systemadministrator. I really love what im doing and I'm passionate about it also in my freetime. I am constantly working on smaller projects. This Blog will mainly contain computer stuff. And Project around my FreeNAS server. 

# Tech stuff
This blog is based on [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) - basically a static site generator. I first wanted to use a well known CMS for this project - but I litteraly hate PHP and web developing in general which lead me to use Jekyll!
The theme is based on [BlackDoc](https://github.com/karloespiritu/BlackDoc) by Karlo Espiritu. Thanks for the awesome theme! [xvzf](https://blog.xvzf.tech/) changed the Colors of the Theme. Thank You!
